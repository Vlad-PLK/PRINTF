This is project PRINTF, a self-made clone of the C version of [printf(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html). 
\
My version can display the following types of variables :
- Type c for character
- Type s for string
- Type p for pointer address
- Type d for decimal integer
- Type u for unsigned integer
- Type x for hexadecimal
- Type X for HEXADECIMAL
\
Creating your own version of printf teaches how to work with different kind of variables but most importly,
you discover how a function with an unknown quantity of arguments works.
Indeed, the prototype of printf is the following one :
int	ft_printf(const char *format, ...)
As you see, it takes a string in first argument, which will hold all the characters and variables that we want to display.
With printf we identify a variable by putting a '%' before it's type.
For example we can have something like :
```C
int  main(void)
{
  int  variable;
  int  printf_result;

  variable = 1;
  printf_result = ft_printf("Hello world %d\n", variable);
  ft_printf("printf_result = %d\n", printf_result);
}
```

As you can see in the first line we have our message and on the second line we have 14. 14 corresponds to the return value of printf which is always the number of characters that it displayed.
Here one more example to illustrate what i'll explain after :
